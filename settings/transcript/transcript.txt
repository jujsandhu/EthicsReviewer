Question:
MR JAY: Mr Wright, the Lawrence issue. First of all,
4 paragraph 14 of your statement, please, where a senior
5 figure within the Superintendents Association made
6 a speech dealing with the repeal of the double jeopardy
7 rule, and you had some influence over him in making that
8 speech?

Answer:
9  The influence was small, possibly. There was influence,
10 I think, that prior to the -- prior to the police
11 Superintendents Association annual conference in
12 September 1997, I had a private meeting with the
13 president, and he gave details of what he was proposing
14 to put in his speech and the same thing he would have
15 said to other reporters as well, and it's just open, but
16 he mentioned that he was interested in the issue of the
17 double jeopardy laws and was going to raise a case in
18 the north-east in relation to his speech.
19 And I said, "Well, actually I'm very interested in
20 this as well in relation to the Stephen Lawrence case,
21 and if there could be a change in the law and if there's
22 suitable evidence came forward, then there might be an
23 opportunity for a retrial." As a result of that, he
24 inserted that in his speech and made a powerful
25 reference to it and used it in a slide show as well. 
1 I just wanted to emphasise once again the positive
2 aspects of being a crime reporter.

Question:
3 And then paragraph 18 of your statement, if I may, which
4 gives us the background to the famous "Murderers" front
5 page in 1997. You were advising Mr Dacre about that and
6 obviously it was going to be his decision as to whether
7 to publish it in that way.

Answer:
8 Yes, it was. In the days and weeks leading up to that
9 front page, and I had no idea that the editor was
10 planning to do that until the eve of publication, but
11 I was making my own enquiries about the case, and it was
12 through what you would describe here as unofficial
13 sources, about the background to the case, the
14 background to the killers. There was an inquest going
15 on and it was a case we were very interested in and on
16 the eve of publication the editor sought my advice on my
17 knowledge on the background of these five. And it in a
18 small way perhaps helped him make his mind up.
