3 Discussion
4 LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Yes, Mr Garnham?
5 MR GARNHAM: Sir, I apologise to you and the other core
6 participants that the statement of Mr Driscoll was
7 circulated very late yesterday evening.
8 It was, however, the result of a great deal of hard
9 work by those who instruct me and Ms Allen of Bindmans
10 who prepared this statement with Mr Driscoll during the
11 course of yesterday afternoon and yesterday evening.
12 LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Yes, I understand. Thank you.
13 Mr Caplan, yes, if you want to say this is timing
14 that verges on the unacceptable, you don't need to say
15 it; I agree.
16 MR CAPLAN: Thank you.
17 LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: The real question is what you want to
18 do about it.
19 MR CAPLAN: Sir, I was going to say that.
20 LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: There you are.
21 MR CAPLAN: Thank you for saying it first. The position as
22 you know obviously is I'm back again today because the
23 crime correspondent of the Daily Mail, Mr Wright, is
24 here and some of what Mr Driscoll says touches very much
25 on Mr Wright's reporting of the Stephen Lawrence matter.

1 He's been reporting about it for the last 15 years.
2 I will say this: the Daily Mail and his reporting has
3 been the subject of a lot of positive comment and
4 awards, and he will deal with it, but it comes very
5 late, he does not want to come back, he'd rather deal
6 with his evidence today. It's extremely unfortunate
7 that it's come as late as it has.
8 LORD JUSTICE LEVESON: Yes, Mr Caplan, to some extent I'm
9 responding to a criticism that I got yesterday that
10 material comes into the Inquiry after witnesses have
11 been and they haven't dealt with it. So I understand
12 why there was an anxiety that we should do it the right
13 way round. If you want more time, then you shall have
14 it and I will make sure it happens. I can understand
15 why Mr Wright wouldn't want to come back; that was the
16 complaint I got yesterday. I can't win, or the Inquiry
17 can't win, whatever we do. We're trying to cope with
18 a fast-moving Inquiry in circumstances where evidence is
19 being generated which we don't know about, we don't know
20 what is out there, so when it's provided, it's
21 inevitable that it's going to cause difficulty.
22 I intend to be very careful about this in the light
23 of what happened yesterday. I've now reviewed with care
24 what the particular witness who was the subject of
25 yesterday's complaint said and I'm not entirely sure
